# Beeautiful

### Jerry Seinfeld, once a proud actor, has been captured by the cruel insect goddess and transformed into a bee.

### The only protection the insect goddess granted Jerry was a small shield that can make him invincible for a few seconds but then runs out.

### The insect goddess gave him only five chances of survival before his soul is lost forever.

### His new goal in life is to survive and avoid being killed by the other bugs that dont like him or his show.

### The only way to restore his humanity is to defeat the devil himself.

### Will Jerry make it out alive?

##### His fate is in your hands.

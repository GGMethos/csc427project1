# Beeautiful

### Jerry Seinfeld, once a proud actor, has been captured by the cruel insect goddess and transformed into a bee.

### A badass bee. The kind that can rapid fire superpowered venomous stings at once (FIVE OF THEM) if leveled up fully. Unfortunately, Jerry must start at level one in the beginning. Level One has a very basic slow tiny sting that does miniscule damage but gets leveled up after twenty fresh kills.

### The only protection the insect goddess granted Jerry was a small shield that can make him invincible for a few seconds but then runs out.

### The insect goddess gave him only five chances of survival before his soul is lost forever.

### His new goal in life is to survive and avoid being killed by the other bugs that dont like him or his show.

### The only way to restore his humanity is to defeat the devil himself.

### Will Jerry make it out alive?

##### His fate is in your hands.
